# Assignment: Epic Button Game
For this assignment, build the app described in the mockup below using Express and sockets.  Your app should serve only a single view, index.ejs.  Any time the epic button is pushed, the count should update on every user who is connected via sockets.  This should happen in real time.  If a user clicks the reset button, the count should reset to 0 for every user as well!
